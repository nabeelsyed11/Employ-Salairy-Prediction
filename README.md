Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict employee salaries based on input features such as education, experience, job title, and other relevant factors. The project showcases the complete workflow from data loading and cleaning to model training and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset contains employee-related information required for salary prediction.
It includes features such as education, years of experience, job title, and more.
(Add dataset source or description here if public.)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/nabeelsyed11/Employ-Salairy-Prediction.git
Change directory:
bash
cd Employ-Salairy-Prediction
Install the required packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(or manually install: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Jupyter, etc.)
Usage
Start Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook
Open the main notebook file (e.g., Salary_Prediction.ipynb).
Run the cells to follow the analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.
