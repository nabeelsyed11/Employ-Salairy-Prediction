## Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various attributes such as education, experience, job title, and other factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we seek to provide accurate salary estimates and analyze the factors that influence compensation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains employee information, including:

- Job Title
- Education Level
- Years of Experience
- Location
- Salary (Target Variable)
- Additional Features (if any)

> **Note:** Please add your dataset source or link here if you are using a public dataset.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, RMSE, etc.)
- Prediction and visualization

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nabeelsyed11/Employ-Salairy-Prediction.git
   cd Employ-Salairy-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can install common packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. **(Optional) Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the repository.
2. Run each cell step by step to:
    - Load and preprocess the data
    - Perform exploratory data analysis
    - Train and evaluate machine learning models
    - Make salary predictions for new data

3. Modify the code as needed for your own data or use case.

## Results

- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy/RMSE of `X` (update with your result).
- Key factors influencing salary include: `List most important features based on your analysis`.
